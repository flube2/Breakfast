# Breakfast

This is what I envision that breakfast in the future could look like when everyone has an augmented reality device readily accessible (AR built into glasses). If you did not come here via the link on my webpage, a detailed description of the project can be found at https://sites.google.com/a/uic.edu/flubekcs491/augmented-reality/project-1-breakfast-in-the-future or if you prefer you could go to https://tinyurl.com/ya3msrpo (My AR/VR Homepage) and navigate to Project 1.
